# QR-Code-Attendance
The proposed system generates unique QR code for every student. The teacher needs to scan the QR code of particular student in order to confirm the student’s attendance. This system enables us to speed up the process of taking attendance and would save us valuable teaching time. This is planned to help students avoid consequences that may result from poor attendances which will eventually penalize them from sitting their final examination as required by the administrators. The device’s camera will be used as a sensor that will read the QR code printed on the students’ cards. The updated attendance list is then uploaded to an online database and can also be saved as a file to be transferred to a PC once it scans the QR Code.
Use "PresentSir.zip" to scan the QR Code using application.
